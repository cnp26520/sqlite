# Overview

I am quite the fan of working with relational databases and wanted to see how I could do that with something that isn't an IDE made just for it.

I was able to populatre two tables with information about champions and their homelands. I was able to join the tables together and query out specific information about them, which I later utilized to make a battle simulator using random number generation.

I wanted to test my knoweldge on relational databases as well as my ability to work with them in python which I had never done before.

# Relational Database

I created a relational database about fictional champions and thier homes of origin. All of the infor was generate for them and the two tables are joined along the primary key of the homelands table.

The two tables talk about the champions. One talks about them as individuals, their weaponry, title, and name. While the other table talks about their homeland. Where they come from, a description of it, and the alignment of the land.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code and sqlite to be able to interact with my databases

I utilized sql queries to write a majority of the code and used python and sqlite to do that.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* I can add more tables and creating a farther branching database
* I can work on utilizing more features of SQL such as Group By or Unions
* I can make changes to the battle code and allow for more interaction
